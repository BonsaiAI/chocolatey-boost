# chocolatey-boost
A chocolatey package for [pre-built boost libraries](http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/); 
targets Visual Studio 2013. For most users the boost nuget packages (found in
the [nuget gallery](http://www.nuget.org/packages/boost/) or on
[github](https://github.com/sergey-shandar/getboost)) are probably a better
fit. This chocolatey package is particularly useful for build systems like
[CMake](http://www.cmake.org) that require all boost libs to be available in 
the same directory.
